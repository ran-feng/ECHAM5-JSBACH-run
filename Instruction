Steps:
1. creating a mh-linux-x86_64 in /echam5j-wiso.2.3/config/ based on "config requirement" included in this project.
2. Make the following changes to the configure file:
host_frag=""
case "${host}" in
    x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)      host_frag=config/mh-linux-x86_64 ;;
3. Run ./configure
4. Add the following libraries to the LIB options in Makefile:
LIB      = -L../lib -lsupport -llapack -lblas -lm -limf
5. Make sure you have the correct flags:
CFLAGS   = -I../config -O -DNAGf90Fortran
FFLAGS   = -fpp -mp -w -openmp -g
F90FLAGS = $(INCLUDES) -fpp -mp -w -openmp -g
CPPFLAGS =
ARFLAGS  = crv
LDFLAGS  = -fpp -mp -w -openmp -g
6. Run gmake
7. Find executable in /echam5j-wiso.2.3/bin
8. Make a run directory, copy and edit runscript, postproessing script and postprocessing toolkit
9. Enjoy!
